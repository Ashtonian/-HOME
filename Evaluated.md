## Denied 

* [bashhub](https://github.com/rcaloras/bashhub-client) - bashhub eery terminal command accross all systems and provides powerful querying across all. Nah - Is saas no local use case. 
* [boilr](https://github.com/tmrts/boilr) - bootstrapper. NO - no useful templates and dead, last commit 2017.
* [krisp.ai](https://krisp.ai/pricing/) - Mute background noise via AI. $$ for use, I have noise cancelling mics... 
* [soulver](https://www.acqualia.com/soulver/) - numi alternative - will prompt like numi after close for $$, seems like the same as numi just older looking and more expensive. 
* [neovim](https://neovim.io/) - not sure value add over vim, doesn't replace emacs + evil mode
* [ls++](https://github.com/trapd00r/ls--) - good but went with https://github.com/dborzov/lsp 
* [selfcontrol](https://selfcontrolapp.com/), [focus](https://heyfocus.com/) - currently use rescuetimes version, like this not sure if this is better. NO - just use rescuetime
* [sshrc](https://github.com/cdown/sshrc) - Bring your .bashrc, .vimrc, etc. with you when you ssh. No - cool but I'm not sure I'd actually use it. 

## Check Again Later

* [raycast](https://raycast.com/) - cool alfred like but for web apps, only a few apps. WATCH! - this is nice potential universal search, limited apps is biggest limiter. 
* [ferdi](https://getferdi.com/) - unified notifications - no signal. WATCH! - this is a nice central notification system where you can interact with apps within the app it seems. Its missing some key apps like signal and I'm not sure if that will ever change due to the nature of signal. 
* [VimMotion](https://github.com/dwarvesf/VimMotionApp) - vim shortcuts for OSX - love this, its just so slow that its unusable. WATCH! - https://github.com/dwarvesf/VimMotionApp/issues/24
* [espanso](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso) - text expander, review later good potential for form replacement, address ect.. maybe even other menial data I don't want to have to lookup. That being said it seems pretty limited currently and wouldn't be put to good use. 
* [dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer/graphs/contributors), or [hidden](https://github.com/dwarvesf/hidden/graphs/contributors) or other when bartender expires
